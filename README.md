## About me

I am a master's student at UIC majoring in Computer Science. My interets are in Data Science and in application of Machine Learning on structured and non-structured data such as images, videos and text.

I am a candidate with demonstrated strong analytical, critical thinking and communication skills with 3 years of work experience in mobile app development. I have a coursework experience in machine learning, deep learning, data science, natural language processing and computer vision.

Following are the list of my completed and ongoing relevant projects:
- Currently, researching on how to improve the state of the art in performance of action segmentation on videos under unsupervised setting.
- Built a [classification and outlier detection model for cyber-attacks](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/CS418-Final-Project). Performed preprocessing, EDA on the dataset with more than 16 million entries and 83 statistical features with a team of 3 students/peers on AWS Sagemaker.
- Built a chatbot application for healthcare which assessed the userâ€™s health and psychological correlates from the userâ€™s interaction and provided a summary of the stylistic analysis of the user.
- Built a [translation model](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/Code-Summarization-Task) based on Transformer architecture, which translates programming language to natural language. The model was trained on a TPU Node in GCP. 
- [Implementation of Spatial Transformer Network](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/STN), it helps in making the convolution neural 
network robust to affine transformations.
