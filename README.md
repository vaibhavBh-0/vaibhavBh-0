## About me

I am a master's degree graduate from UIC in Computer Science. My interests are in Data Science and in application of Machine Learning on structured and non-structured data such as images, videos and text.

I am a candidate with demonstrated strong analytical, critical thinking and communication skills with 3 years of work experience in mobile app development. I have a 6 months professional & coursework experience in machine learning, deep learning, data science, natural language processing and computer vision.

Following are the list of my completed and ongoing relevant projects:
<!-- - Currently, researching on how to improve the state of the art in performance of action segmentation on videos under unsupervised setting. -->
- Developed [novel ways](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/NVAE) to improve disentangled representations by estimating Total Correlation across stochastic layers of Hierarchical
VAE, [NVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03898).
- Implemented a [multi-modal text and image model](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/VisualWSD) for [SemEval 2023 Task](https://raganato.github.io/vwsd) on Google Cloud Platform inspired by <b>CLIP</b> and <b>LiT</b>. Retrieved relevant image conditioned on text context with a <b>custom contrastive loss</b> function based on this task.
- Constructed a data pipeline for <b>YOLO v7</b> for real-time object detection with <b>mosaic data augmentation</b>.
- Built a [classification and outlier detection model for cyber-attacks](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/CS418-Final-Project). Performed <b>data preprocessing, EDA </b> on the dataset with more than <b>16 million records</b>. and 83 statistical features with. Led a team of 3 students/peers on AWS Sagemaker.
- Built a <b>chatbot application</b> for healthcare which assessed the userâ€™s health and psychological correlates from the userâ€™s interaction and provided a summary of the stylistic analysis of the user.
- Built a [translation model](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/Code-Summarization-Task) based on Transformer architecture, which translates programming language to natural language. The model was trained on a TPU Node in GCP. 
- [Implementation of Spatial Transformer Network](https://github.com/vaibhavBh-0/STN), it helps in making the convolution neural 
network robust to affine transformations.
